## Spawn-Store

##### A Game Store where user can download their games. For being competitor in the market I have added some Paid games though games can be paid via transaction simulation process. There are also free games available at the store. In this site, if user forgets his password they can reset by using email authentication code for verification. I have used Google Client API for sign in with Google. To run this project there are some files required such as vendor, TCPDF. To get this files you can knock me where I am available.
